Each of these arrays is a sound style.  Each array consists of a set of sound
 resources in res/raw.  The array is referenced in com.emirac.bonk.SoundManager.arrayIDs,
 and the ordering there should correspond to the indeces in soundStyles above.
 Within each style array below the resource items should be ordered treble to bass.
 If there's only one item in the style array then the wallpaper will play the one
 sound at various rates to create different pitches.  If there are multiple items then
 the wallpaper will use each item as a discreet pitch (treble to bass).
